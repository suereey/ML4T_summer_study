# The Fundamental Law of active portfolio management
## Grindol's Fundamental Law
- Performance
- Skill
- Breadth
- Expression: **Performance = skill*(breadth)^0.5**
    - So to imporve performance, you can either imporve skill, or find more applications or methods or oppertunities for applying that skill.
- **IR = IC *(breadth)^0.5**
    - Performance can be summarized as **IR** (information ratio)
    - Skill can be summarized in sth called Inforamtion Coefficient
    - Breadth is just how many trading opportunities we have.

## Coin flipping casino
- General conclusion: don't put all your eggs in 1 basket!
- Coin flipping in casino:

- To consider which senario is better, we need to consider **Reward and Risk**
    - Reward is the same
    ![reward](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suereey/ML4T_summer_study/main/02_screenshot/59_coinbet_reward.PNG)
    - Risk is lower with Bet 2: 1 token on each table
        - Risk 1: Loss all money
        - Risk 2: Standard deviation

## Real world problem
- Real world example
![realworld](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suereey/ML4T_summer_study/main/02_screenshot/61_realworldlaw.PNG)
- IR, IC, Breadth:
    - IR: calculate the sharpe ratio of the skill (like how we calculated our portfolio).**The sharpe ratio of skill component is the information ratio**
    - IC: correlation 
    - Breadth: Buffet = 120 (although no trade)

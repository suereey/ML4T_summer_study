- In sample vs out of sample: KNN's training sample can have very small error. But measuring the error for Test samples are more important.
- Cross validation: Split data and run different trail. For example: Use the bottom 4 as training data and 1st one as test data (This is 1 trail). In total, this graph can have 5 trails.

- Roll forward corss validation:
        -Cross validation does not fit financial data application (need to predict future).
        - The trial above with test data infront of training data is not okay. (Training data is always before test data!)

# Efficient Market Hypothesis
## EMH Assumptions
- EMH Assumptions

## Where does information come from?
- Price/volume
- Fundamental 
- Exogenous (information about the world that affects the company. For example, if you look at airline company, the prices of oil will affect the the price of the airline stocks)
- Company insiders 

## 3 Forms of the EMH
- Weak: future prices cannot be predicted by analyzing historical prices.
- Semi-strong: Prices adjust rapidly to new public information
- Strong: Prices reflect all information public and private. (strong version of EMH says we can't even make money on insider information. Prices reflect all information including public and private.)
- EMH Prohibits:

- Is the EMH correct?
    - Strong version of EMH are least solid
    - Semi strong:
        - P/E ratio: price to earning, x-axis. The smaller the better
        - How much money did it make in terms of price over 20 yr, y-axis
        - Example:
        ![P/E](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suereey/ML4T_summer_study/main/02_screenshot/56_emh.PNG)
        - **Low P/E ratios (good) corresponding to higher returns. So this shows that price/earnings ratios are very predictive across many decades of future returns. This tends to refute the semi-strong version of the EMH.**

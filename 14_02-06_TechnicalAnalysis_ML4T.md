# Technical Analysis
## Two broad categrories of approaches to choose stock:
- Fundamental analysis: Comapny value
    - purchase when price of a company is below its value
- Technical analysis (our focus): Patterns or trends in a stock's price

## Characteristics of Technical Analysis
- What is it
    - historical **price** and **volume** ONLY
    - compute statistics called **indicators**
    - indicators are heuristics that may hin at a buy or sell oppertunity
- Why it might work?
    - there is information in price
    - heuristics work
- When is technical analysis valuable?
    - Individual indicators by them selves are weakly predictive
    - Combining multiple indicators adds value
    - Look for contrasts (stock vs market)
    - Working better for shorter time periods 
        - Short term: technical analysis
        - Long term: fundamental analysis

- Normalization
    - normalized the indicator to 0 - 1

- **Wrap up of Technical Analysis**
    - **Heruistics** (represent someone's interpretation or hunch of how a statistical apporach to previous prcies and volume might suggest future price movement)
    - Tucker's approach (as an example)
    - Don't start trading yet :)

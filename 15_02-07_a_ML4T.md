# Dealing with Data
## How data is aggregated
- Many trades are happening on different exchanges, how shall we combine, analyze, and use them?
- Tick: The finest resolution of data is called a tick. A tick represents a successful buy sell match or a successful transaction.
- Example, figure below, in each time period, we have:
    - Open: 1 st one 
    - High: highest one
    - Low: lowest one
    - close: last one
    - volumn: total volumn during that time period.

## Price anomaly
- Stock split example:
    ![stocksplit]()
- Stock splits result in reduced price per unit.
For instance, say each stock unit is divided into two units, then the value of each new unit drops to half. This is what likely happened.
- Why stock split? **Price too high**

# Market Mechanics
## Order
- What is in an order?
    - Buy or sell?
    - Symbol: identifier for your target ETF
    - number of shares: Stocks, ETFs and other assets are sold in units of shares, not by amount of money
    - Limit or Market
        - Market: willing to accept a good price but essentially whatever price the market is currently bearing
        - Limit: don't want to do any worse than a certain price
    - Price: market order cannot specify the price.
    - Example: 
        - (BUY, IBM, 100, LIMIT, 99.5) i want to buy 100 shares of IBM AT NO MORE THAN 99.95$
        - (sell, GOOG, 150, MARKET) i want to sell 150 google shares at market price

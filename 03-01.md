## Supervised regression learning
- Supervised: provice example X, Y
- regression: numerical prediction
- learning: train with data
- Different methods:
    - Linear regression (parametric)
    - Knearest neighbor (KNN) (instance based)
    - Decision trees
    - Decision forests

Note: Difference between parametric and instance based method?

- In parametric, we take the data and merge around to come up with a few parameters, and then THROW data away.
- In KNN, we keep all the historical data, the X and Y pairs, when it's time to make a prediction, we consult that data.

## Stock data for ML
